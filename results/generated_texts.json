This bold and flavorful recipe is perfect for a quick and satisfying weeknight dinner.\n\nTo start, bring a large pot of water to a boil. Add a pinch of salt to the water and then add the pasta. Cook until it is al dente, which literally means \"to the tooth\". This means that the pasta should still have a little bite to it, not too soft, not too chewy.\n\nWhile the pasta is cooking, heat some olive oil in a large skillet over medium heat. Add some chopped garlic and cook it until it is fragrant and golden brown. Be careful not to burn the garlic as it can turn bitter.\n\nNext, add the tomato sauce to the skillet. Stir in the olives, capers, and anchovies. These ingredients add a briny and salty flavor to the dish. However, be careful with the anchovies, as they can be quite overpowering. If you're not a fan, you can omit them from the recipe.\n\nSimmer the sauce for a few minutes to allow the flavors to meld together",

The flavors are all over the place, just like your taste in food. Let me enlighten you on how to cook a real pasta dish that actually tastes good.
