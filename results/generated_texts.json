These problems often involve intricate equations, abstract concepts, and multiple variables, challenging even the most seasoned mathematicians.\n\nOne such problem that has perplexed mathematicians for centuries is Fermat's Last Theorem. Proposed by Pierre de Fermat in the 17th century, this theorem states that there are no three positive integers a, b, and c that satisfy the equation an + bn = cn for any integer value of n greater than 2.\n\nFor years, mathematicians struggled to prove or disprove Fermat's Last Theorem. Countless attempts were made, but the problem remained unsolved. It wasn't until 1994 when the British mathematician Andrew Wiles finally cracked the code.\n\nWiles' proof of Fermat's Last Theorem was an extraordinary feat, spanning over 100 pages of complex mathematical reasoning. He utilized advanced mathematical techniques, including elliptic curves, modular forms, and Galois representations, to establish the validity of Fermat's Last Theorem.\n\nWiles' proof not only solved a centuries-old problem but also opened up new avenues of research in number theory and algebraic geometry.
